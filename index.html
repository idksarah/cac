      <p>California faces increasing wildfire threats every year — but most tools focus on individual fires, not the bigger picture of community risk. WildRisk brings together real-time wildfire data, drought conditions, and local demographics into an interactive map that helps residents, researchers, and policymakers visualize which counties are most at risk.</p>
      <p>By overlaying live fire perimeters with population, area, drought severity, and historical wildfire frequency, WildRisk provides an intuitive, data-driven overview of wildfire vulnerability across California. Users can click any county to see a dynamic dashboard with charts showing population exposure, recent fire counts, and risk levels — all powered by Leaflet, Chart.js, and open-source GeoJSON data.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to make wildfire risk understandable at a glance — empowering communities to prepare smarter, allocate resources better, and track how drought and fire seasons evolve over time. WildRisk turns raw geospatial data into actionable insights — because knowing where the danger lies is the first step toward resilience.</p>
